# wide-tim

Verification bot, currently for MIT 2027 server.

On the future, support will be added for any MIT Discord server, and potentially other authentication methods.

Somewhat based on [Swolen't Tim](https://github.com/gabrc52/swolent-tim), check that bot for anonymous confessions, multi-server support, and more.

Succesor of [Swole Tim](https://github.com/sipb/swole-tim).
